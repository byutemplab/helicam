USB drivers

By default Linux configures USB devices so that they are owned by root. You should be running your executables as yourself, not root.
For that, this package (libhelic-dev) create a rules-file "45-heliotis.rules" in /lib/udev/rules.d/
By default, the group to use the heliCam C3 is defined as "heliotis".

To use the heliCam C3 with a preferred user, you can the following steps:
----------- USB permissions (1) -----------
   create a group with the name "heliotis" and put the users that will use the "heliCam C3" in this group.
   sudo groupadd heliotis
   sudo adduser heliotis <username>
   Reboot the computer after this two commands. check the entry with: "groups"

----------- USB permissions (2) -----------      
   change the rules-file: /lib/udev/rules.d/45-heliotis.rules

   SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0852", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0081", MODE="666", GROUP="<yourUserGroup>" #"HeliCam"
   SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04b4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="8613", MODE="666", GROUP="<yourUserGroup>" #"HeliCam - No EEPROM"

----------- USB permissions (3) -----------
other solution are also possible...
